Acme Solutions — Static demo site

This folder contains a simple, professional static HTML website.

Files:
- `index.html` — main page
- `css/styles.css` — stylesheet
- `assets/logo.svg` — simple logo

How to view locally

Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or serve it with a simple HTTP server (recommended):

PowerShell (from the `static-website` folder):

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

Notes

- The contact form is non-functional (demo only).
- Replace placeholder images and copy with your brand assets.
